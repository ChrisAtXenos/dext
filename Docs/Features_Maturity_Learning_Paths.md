## Learning Paths

Dext is modular by design. Thanks to the **Delphi Smart Linker**, the compiler natively strips any unused units from the final compiled binary. This means Dext can be adopted as an ultra-lightweight micro-framework (focused solely on Minimal APIs) or as a comprehensive enterprise suite, without any bloat overhead!

To simplify the learning curve and prevent cognitive overload, we have divided the framework into **5 focused Learning Paths**:

### Detailed Learning Path Mapping

#### 🚀 Path A — Web APIs & Microservices (Micro-Framework Focus)
*   **Target:** Developers who need to build lightweight, fast, and scalable REST APIs, or replace tools like Horse with superior structural robustness and native DI.
*   **What to learn:**
    1.  **Bootstrapping & Minimal API** — Spin up the server fluently and map routes directly.
    2.  **Middleware Pipeline** — Adding security, CORS, custom exception handling, and compression.
    3.  **JSON Engine** — Mastering ultra-fast record/class serialization (DOM and UTF-8 low-level).
    4.  **REST Client** — Consuming external APIs with high-performance TCP connection pooling.

#### 💾 Path B — Persistence Engineering (ORM & Enterprise Focus)
*   **Target:** Software engineers managing high-concurrency databases who want to eliminate manual SQL strings by using strongly-typed LINQ and bulletproof Change Tracking.
*   **What to learn:**
    1.  **Core Persistence** — Understanding the lifecycle of `TDbContext`, `DbSet<T>`, and the Identity Map.
    2.  **Smart Types & Expression Trees** — Composing complex queries using smart properties.
    3.  **Soft Delete and JSON Columns** — Automating logical deletes and interacting natively with JSONB columns.
    4.  **Bulk Operations & Multi-Tenancy** — High-performance mass persistence and tenant isolation (Shared DB or DB-per-tenant).

#### 🏢 Path C — Legacy ERP Modernization (RAD & Clean Architecture Focus)
*   **Target:** Development teams managing legacy VCL/FMX systems with millions of lines of code who want clean, testable, UI-decoupled architectures (MVVM) without losing Delphi IDE's design-time drag-and-drop speed.
*   **What to learn:**
    1.  **Dependency Injection** — Configuring the global IoC container, managing lifecycles (Singleton, Scoped, Transient), and scope isolation.
    2.  **EntityDataSet** — Linking in-memory POCO collections to Delphi visual components in design-time (with Sync Fields and Live Data Preview).
    3.  **Magic Binding & MVVM** — Sincronizing View and ViewModel data automatically without view code-behind.

#### 📊 Path D — Observability & Telemetry (APM & Diagnostics Focus)
*   **Target:** Tech Leads and DevOps engineers who need to monitor Delphi microservices in production, detect slow database queries, and profile external network calls.
*   **What to learn:**
    1.  **Tracing & Ring Buffer** — Collecting and rendering hierarchical Gantt execution spans and asynchronous logs.
    2.  **RED Metrics** — Monitoring throughput (RPS, QPS) and CPU/Memory resource consumption.
    3.  **DB & Outbound Profiler** — Intercepting and profiling slow FireDAC SQL commands and external network request latency.

#### 🤖 Path E — AI, DX & Automation (AI & Modern Developer Experience Focus)
*   **Target:** Forward-thinking developers who want to accelerate their daily coding using artificial intelligence or build cutting-edge systems connected to autonomous AI agents.
*   **What to learn:**
    1.  **MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)** — Securely exposing tools and data from your Delphi app directly to LLMs (like Claude and GPT).
    2.  **AI Skills** — Configuring Cursor/Antigravity to generate flawless, highly idiomatic Dext code.
    3.  **Testing Framework** — Writing robust RTTI-based test suites using Fluent Assertions, Mocks, and Snapshot Testing.
    4.  **Dext CLI** — Using the terminal to speed up project creation and code units scaffolding.
